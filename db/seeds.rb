# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# Category.destroy_all
# User.destroy_all
#
# admin = User.create(username: "admin", password: "admin", role: "admin")
# admin.save
#
# mohib = User.create(username: "mohib", password: "mohib", role: "user")
# mohib.save
#
# musab = User.create(username: "musab", password: "musab", role: "user")
# musab.save
